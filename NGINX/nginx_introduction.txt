### Introduction

NGINX is a powerful web server and reverse proxy widely used in modern backend development. When combined with Java applications (e.g., using Spring Boot), it enhances performance, scalability, and security.

---

### 🔁 1. Reverse Proxy

**Purpose:** Acts as an intermediary between the client and backend Java servers.

**Benefits:**

* Hides backend servers from the public
* Load balances between multiple servers
* Centralized SSL management

**Example:**

```
Client → NGINX → Java App (port 8080)
```

---

### 🌐 2. Web Server (Static Hosting)

**Purpose:** Serves static files like HTML, CSS, JS, images.

**Benefits:**

* High performance for static content
* Reduces load on backend services

**Example:**
Host frontend React/Vue build folder with NGINX.

---

### 🔐 3. SSL Termination (HTTPS)

**Purpose:** Handles HTTPS connections and offloads SSL responsibilities.

**Benefits:**

* Simplifies SSL setup
* Integrates with Let's Encrypt for free certificates

**Example:**

```
Client → HTTPS (NGINX) → HTTP (Java Backend)
```

---

### 🚦 4. Load Balancing

**Purpose:** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers.

**Benefits:**

* Increases availability
* Prevents a single server from being overloaded

**Example:**

```
NGINX → Server 1 (Java)
      → Server 2 (Java)
```

### 🛡️ 5. Security and Rate Limiting

**Purpose:** Adds protection against malicious users and abuse.

**Benefits:**

* Blocks suspicious IPs
* Limits requests per client (DDoS protection)

---

### 🚪 6. Routing & URL Rewriting

**Purpose:** Redirect or rewrite URLs to match routing rules.

**Benefits:**

* Clean, SEO-friendly URLs
* Supports SPA frontends and multiple services

**Example:**

* `/api/*` → Java backend
* `/` → Frontend static files

---

### 📦 7. Caching

**Purpose:** Stores and serves cached responses.

**Benefits:**

* Reduces backend load
* Improves response speed for frequent requests
