ðŸŒ± Introduction to Spring Framework
Spring is a powerful, feature-rich Java framework widely used for building enterprise-level applications. It provides a comprehensive infrastructure for developing Java applications, especially focusing on dependency injection (DI), aspect-oriented programming (AOP), and modular architecture.

Key Features:

Lightweight and modular

Supports dependency injection and loose coupling

Provides robust transaction management

Integrates with various technologies (JPA, JMS, Security, etc.)

Use Case Example:
Creating complex business applications with layered architecture.



ðŸš€ Introduction to Spring Boot
Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring Framework that simplifies the process of building and deploying production-ready standalone applications. It removes boilerplate configuration by offering opinionated defaults, embedded servers, and auto-configuration.

Key Features:

Embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty)

Auto-configuration based on dependencies

Production-ready with built-in metrics and health checks

Simplifies REST API development

Use Case Example:
Quickly building microservices or RESTful APIs without extensive configuration.
